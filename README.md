## About
In recent times, oversharing of children's information on social media platforms has become a common practice. At the same time, parents are forgoing the creation of scrapbooks and baby books for these social media platforms, and it makes sense! Parents are busy, and most of their photos are on their phones and tablets. The purpose of this web application is to provide modern parents a platform where they can safely and privately save precious memories of their children in one place, while avoiding the dangers of damage and loss of those memories, as well as the prying eyes and technologies of social media. This application currently includes a story page, a photo album, and a weight tracker. 

## Challenges
The primary technical challenge that the team faced while working on this application was understanding how to properly use and connect all the technologies needed for this application, especially React, Redux, and MongoDB, and AWS S3. React and MongoDB were slightly familiar at the time of this app's creation. However, Redux and AWS S3 were completely unfamiliar technologies. This challenge was overcome by reading documentation, following tutorials, and asking for help when necessary.

## How It Works
* First, visit the application's URL.
* Then, signin/signup.
* Next, Add text, photos, and weights.
* Last, view the timeline, photo gallery, and weight tracker. You will see the information you entered!
